 * Depends on a 256colors terminal.

 * @fixme: Support for 88colors and 16colors terminals might be cool.
 *         Of course, I don’t really care about it, because 256 > 88 > 16,
 *         but some people might want to use those anyway.
 *
 *         88c terminals should basically s/6/4/g;s/5/3/g. Not sure about 16c.
 *
 * Also note that grayscales are pretty much wasted with this thing, being
 * limited to 6 shades instead of the 24 available.
